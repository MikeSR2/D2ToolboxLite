discord.help.message=This is a very simple bot for looking weapon rolls. \n\n Use `!godRoll weaponName/language` \n Example `!godRoll Beloved/en` \n **en** is for english \n **es** is for spanish (Spain) \n **mx** is for spanish (Mexico) \n Yeah yeah, It should be the same, but the weapon names are different between these two locations, ask Bungie. \n If language is not provided, then English will be used. \n It just works on weapons with random rolls, exotics, ritual and year one weapons are excluded \n\n The source of the information shown in this bot is gathered from the light.gg website but it is not owned or controlled by light.gg or vice versa.
